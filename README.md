# jam!

Jam is an experimental live coding music IDE. I haven't had much time to hack
on it yet, but I'm making my current progress available in unfinished form.
Please pardon the mess!

The core ideas behind jam are:

 * Make music at many levels of abstraction -- voices, patterns, compositions
 * Hear the changes you make in code as quickly as possible
 * If possible, provide a graphical view to complement code and sound
